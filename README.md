### Congratulations on wanting to protect your images online. 

The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible to project the images on your site.

There are a few things you need access to:

1. Your server where your domain is hosted. 
You need to be able to upload files to your server. There are workarounds for this but to make it as easy as possible server access is required
2. Your stylesheet (example: styles.css).


### Initial setup

I include an example html file to get you started. The file is labeled 'example.html' so you can't miss it.
You will notice that everything works with a div wrapped around an img tag with a class of 'protected' and 'unprotected' which are referenced in the separate style.css file and include the specific media targeting for mobile devices to disallow touch events on images.

### Disabling right-clicking on entire page.

This is a simple snippet of javascript.
