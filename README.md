### Congratulations on wanting to protect your images online. 

The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible to project the images on your site.

There are a few things you need access to:

1. Your server where your domain is hosted. 
You need to be able to upload files to your server. There are workarounds for this but to make it as easy as possible server access is required
2. Your stylesheet (example: styles.css).
